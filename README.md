# XMM ‚Äì Cross‚ÄëGame Mod Manager

![Characters List](https://cdn.evilnick.net/xmm-assets/imgs/characters.png)

**A modern, cross-platform manager for gacha games, built with Tauri and React.**

> **Formerly Genshin Mod Manager (GMM).**  The project was renamed to **XMM** to reflect its multi‚Äëgame scope and to distance the codebase from the original upstream repository.  XMM is a clean‚Äëroom continuation that strips all un‚Äëaudited code while retaining every freedom guaranteed by the GPL‚Äë3.0 license.

XMM aims to simplify the process of installing, organizing, and switching between game mods. It provides a clean user interface and useful tools like presets and keybind viewing.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **üéÆ Multi-Game Support:** Manage mods for different games (currently supports **Genshin Impact**, **Honkai: Star Rail**, **Zenless Zone Zero**, and **Wuthering Waves**) with separate configurations and databases. Easily switch between supported games.
*   **üóÇÔ∏è Mod Library & Categorization:** Automatically scans your mods folder and organizes mods by category (Characters, Weapons, UI, etc.) and entity for the selected game.
*   **üñ±Ô∏è Simple Enable/Disable:** Easily toggle mods on or off with a switch. GMM handles the `DISABLED_` prefix renaming for you.
*   **üñ±Ô∏è Drag & Drop Import:** Drag archive files (.zip, .7z, .rar) directly onto the application window to initiate the import process.
*   **üì¶ Enhanced Archive Import (.zip, .7z, .rar):** Import mods directly from archive files. GMM analyzes contents (including INI hints), suggests mod details, allows root folder selection, or extracts all files.
*   **ü§ñ Advanced Mod Info Deduction:** Attempts to deduce mod name, author, and target entity from folder structure, internal filenames, and INI files during scan/import.
*   **‚ú® Presets System:** Save your current mod setup as a preset for the active game and quickly switch between different mod combinations. Mark favorites for quick access via the sidebar.
*   **üìä Enhanced Dashboard:** Get a quick glance at your library stats for the active game, including total mods, enabled/disabled counts, and category breakdowns with visual charts.
*   **üöÄ Quick Launch Integration:** Configure a path to your game executable or a mod launcher for one-click launching. Supports standard launch and **elevated (Admin) launch** on Windows if required.
*   **‚å®Ô∏è Keybind Viewer:** Quickly view keybinds defined within a mod's INI files (specifically looks for `key = ...` lines within `[Key.*]` sections *after* a `; Constants` marker).
*   **üñºÔ∏è Image Previews & Lightbox:** Automatically detects and displays common preview images (`preview.png`, etc.). Allows changing previews via file selection or pasting. Click previews to view them in a larger lightbox overlay.
*   **üñ±Ô∏è Context Menu Actions:** Right-click on mods (in list view) for quick actions like opening the mod folder, adding to presets, editing, or deleting.
*   **üîÑ Built-in Updater:** Stay up-to-date with the latest features and fixes via the integrated updater (powered by Tauri).
*   **ü¶Ä Tauri Powered:** Built with Rust (backend) and React (frontend) via Tauri for a fast and efficient cross-platform experience.

## üöÄ Usage Guide

1.  **Initial Setup:**
    *   On first launch, you'll be prompted to select the game you want to configure first (e.g., Genshin Impact).
    *   You *must* select the main folder where you store your mods for that specific game (e.g., `...\GIMI\Mods`).
    *   Optionally, select the game or launcher executable for Quick Launch for that game.
2.  **Switching Games:** Use the game switcher on the **Dashboard** or in the **Initial Setup** screen. Switching games requires an application restart (XMM will prompt and handle this). Settings and mods are kept separate for each game.
3.  **Scanning:** After setting the mods folder for a game, go to **Settings -> Scan Mods Folder -> Scan Now**. This populates the library for the *currently active* game.
4.  **Importing:**
    *   **Method 1 (Button):** Click the **Import Mod** button in the sidebar. Select a `.zip`, `.7z`, or `.rar` archive.
    *   **Method 2 (Drag & Drop):** Drag and drop a supported archive file directly onto the XMM window.
    *   **Process:** Review the detected archive contents. XMM may suggest a root folder. Select the correct **Mod Root Folder** (containing the INI/mod files) OR check **Extract All Files**. Fill in/correct the Mod Name, Target Entity (for the current game), and other details. Click **Confirm Import**.
5.  **Browsing:** Use the sidebar to navigate the library for the *currently active* game. Click on an entity card (e.g., Raiden Shogun) to view its mods.
6.  **Managing Mods:**
    *   Click the toggle switch on a mod card (Grid view) or list item (List view) to enable or disable it.
    *   Use the pencil icon to edit mod details (name, description, author, tags, preview image, target entity).
    *   Use the trash icon to delete a mod (removes from disk and database).
    *   Use the keyboard icon to view detected keybinds.
    *   Right-click a mod in list view for context menu actions (Open Folder, Add to Preset, Edit, Delete).
    *   Click on mod preview images to view them larger in a lightbox.
7.  **Bulk Actions (List View):**
    *   Check the boxes next to mods in the list view.
    *   Use the "Enable Selected" / "Disable Selected" buttons that appear in the header.
8.  **Presets:**
    *   Presets are specific to the *currently active* game.
    *   Go to the **Presets** page.
    *   Enter a name and click **Create Preset** to save the current mod configuration for this game.
    *   Click the play icon next to a preset to apply it.
    *   Use other icons to overwrite, favorite (appears in sidebar), or delete presets.
9.  **Quick Launch:** Click the **Quick Launch** button in the sidebar. GMM will attempt a standard launch first. If that fails with an elevation error (on Windows), it will prompt for admin permission to launch elevated.
